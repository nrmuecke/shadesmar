        <h5 class="subhead">This planet is where the Mistborn Novels take place. There are currently two eras that exist within this series,
            the first detailing how the pantheon, government and society came about during the second era which takes place several hundred
            years later.

                    Two Shards influence this world, Preservation and Ruin. You may be able to tell based on their names that they are
                    constantly at odds with one another.

                    On this planet, the type of power used is called the metallic arts. We'll just talk about one of them here: Allomancy.
                    Certain individuals have the ability to ingest metals, and by doing so would gain investiture. Some would gain the ability
                    to push or pull on metals, others could influence emotions, and still others could gain immense amounts of strength.
                    At the beginning of the Mistborn series there are 10 known allomantic metals, each of which giving a certain power
                    to those who have the ability to ingest them.
